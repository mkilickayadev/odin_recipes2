# odin_recipes2
This project requires the coder to create a web page that represents cook recipes. 
By doing this, the coder practices,
    - managing the folder organization for a web page,
    - creating boilerplate,
    - founding the main page and giving links to the pages of it,
    - using headings, ordered/unordered lists, paragraphs, images.

I preferred three cook recipes:
    - lentil soup
    - green bean
    - red mullet fish
