    <!-- Description of the recipe -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple and popular side dish, often featuring a garlic and butter or lemon dressing, begins with prepping the green beans. 
    The fresh beans are typically trimmed and then briefly cooked to achieve a bright green color and tender-crisp texture. 
    This can be done by blanching (boiling for 3-5 minutes, then plunging into ice water to stop the cooking) or by sautéing them in a skillet with 
    a splash of water, which creates steam to soften them internally before the water evaporates. 
    This initial cooking step is key to preserving their vibrant color and slight bite.</p>

    <p>Once the beans are cooked through to your desired doneness, the final flavor is added in a hot skillet. 
    Butter or olive oil is melted over medium heat, and minced garlic is quickly sautéed until fragrant (being careful not to burn it). 
    The pre-cooked green beans are then added to the skillet and tossed with the garlic and fat, seasoning them generously with salt and pepper. 
    Many recipes enhance the flavor further with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice for brightness, a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese for saltiness, 
    or even a dash of Dijon mustard or red pepper flakes for an extra kick. The dish is served immediately as a quick, flavorful complement to any 
    main course.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh Green Beans: 1 pound (ends trimmed)</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter or Olive Oil: 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Garlic: 3–4 cloves (minced)</li>
        <li>Salt: To taste (Kosher or sea salt)</li>
        <li>Black Pepper: To taste (freshly ground)</li>
        <li>(Optional) Water: About $1/4$ cup (if you are steaming them first)</li>
        <li>(Optional) Lemon Juice: 1 teaspoon (for a bright finish)</li>           
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim the Beans: Rinse the green beans thoroughly. Snap or trim off the tough ends (stems) of the beans.</li>
        <li>Cook the Beans (Sauté-Steam Method): Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the trimmed green beans and about $1/4$ cup of water. 
            Cover the skillet and let the beans steam for 3 to 5 minutes, until they are bright green and slightly tender-crisp. 
            Remove the lid and let any remaining water evaporate completely.</li>
        <li>Sauté the Garlic: Once the skillet is dry, reduce the heat to medium. Add the butter (or olive oil) and minced garlic to the skillet. 
            Sauté for about 30 to 60 seconds until the garlic is fragrant, being very careful not to let it burn.</li>
        <li>Finish and Season: Toss the green beans vigorously with the melted butter and garlic mixture to coat them well. 
            Season generously with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve: If using, stir in the optional squeeze of fresh lemon juice for brightness. 
            Transfer the green beans immediately to a serving dish and enjoy hot.</li>
    </ol>
