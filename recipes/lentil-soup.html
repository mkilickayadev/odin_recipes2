    <!-- Description of the recipe -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This traditional Turkish soup is incredibly simple, wholesome, and ready in under 45 minutes. Begin by rinsing 1 cup of red lentils thoroughly 
        until the water runs clear. In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sauté 1 chopped onion (and optionally 1 chopped carrot for added 
        sweetness) until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the rinsed lentils to the pot along with 6 cups of hot water or broth and 1 teaspoon of salt. 
        Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and let it simmer until the lentils are completely soft and disintegrated, which usually
         takes about 25-30 minutes.</p>
    <p>Once the lentils are tender, remove the pot from the heat and use an immersion blender (or a regular blender) to blend the soup until it achieves 
        a smooth, creamy consistency. If the soup is too thick, add a little more hot water until the desired texture is reached, then stir in 1/2 teaspoon
        of black pepper. For the final touch, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a small pan, stir in 1 teaspoon of dried mint and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper 
        flakes (pul biber), and cook for 15 seconds until fragrant. Ladle the hot soup into bowls and drizzle the mint-infused butter on top before serving
         with a wedge of fresh lemon.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup red lentils</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium carrot, chopped (optional)</li>
            <li>6 cups hot water or vegetable/chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried mint (nane)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (pul biber) (optional)</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and Chop: Rinse the red lentils thoroughly. Chop the onion and the carrot (if using) roughly.</li>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: In a large pot, heat the olive oil. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes until softened. 
            Add the carrot and sauté for 1 more minute.</li>
        <li>Add & Simmer: Add the rinsed lentils, hot water/broth, and salt to the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer 
            for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils are very soft.</li>
        <li>Blend: Remove the pot from the heat. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until it is completely smooth and creamy. Stir in the black pepper. 
            (Add more hot water if the soup is too thick.)</li>
        <li>Prepare the Garnish: In a small pan, melt the butter. Once melted, stir in the dried mint and red pepper flakes (if using). 
            Cook for about 15 seconds until the mint becomes fragrant.</li>
        <li>Serve: Ladle the hot soup into bowls. Drizzle the mint-infused butter sauce over the top of each serving. 
            Serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
    </ol>
