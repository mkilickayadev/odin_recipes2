    <!-- Description of the recipe -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This preparation of Red Mullet, often seen pan-fried or grilled, typically focuses on highlighting the delicate flavor of the fish itself. 
    The cleaning process is meticulous, removing scales and entrails, though some recipes leave the head on. The fish is then lightly scored on the 
    sides and generously seasoned with sea salt, black pepper, and sometimes a dusting of flour or a light coating of olive oil. 
    It is then placed in a hot pan or on a grill, ensuring the skin side is down first if pan-frying to achieve a perfect, crisp texture.</p>

    <p>The cooking time is quite short, usually just 3 to 4 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fish, until the flesh is opaque 
    and flakes easily. A classic accompaniment involves simply basting the fish with butter, olive oil, and fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary 
    during the final minutes of cooking. The dish is often served whole, garnished with lemon wedges and a light sauce made from the pan drippings, 
    parsley, and capers, providing a bright, acidic counterpoint to the rich, savory fish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Red Mullet Fish: 2-4 whole fish (scaled and gutted, or as fillets)</li>
        <li>Olive Oil: A few tablespoons for frying</li>
        <li>Plain Flour or Cornflour: Small amount for dusting (optional, but recommended for crispy skin)</li>
        <li>Sea Salt: To taste</li>
        <li>Freshly Ground Black Pepper: To taste</li>
        <li>Lemon: 1 (cut into wedges, for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Fish: Rinse the cleaned red mullet (or fillets) under cold water and pat them thoroughly dry using paper towels. 
            If using, lightly score the skin side of the whole fish a couple of times.
        <li>Season and Dust: Season the fish generously inside and out (or both sides of the fillets) with sea salt and black pepper. 
            If you desire a crispier skin, lightly dust the fish with plain flour, shaking off any excess.
        <li>Heat the Pan: Place a large non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and allow it to get very hot, 
            until it shimmers slightly.
        <li>Pan-Fry (Skin Side): Carefully place the fish in the hot pan, starting with the skin side down. Press down gently with a spatula for the 
            first few seconds to ensure the skin makes full contact with the pan. Cook undisturbed for about 3 to 4 minutes until the skin is 
            golden-brown and crisp, and the flesh has turned opaque halfway up the side.
        <li>Flip and Finish (Optional Basting): Gently flip the fish. If using, add the butter, herbs, and garlic to the pan. 
            Baste the fish by tilting the pan and spooning the melted butter mixture over the fish continuously as it finishes cooking. 
            Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until the fish is fully opaque and flakes easily when tested.
        <li>Serve: Remove the fish from the pan and let it rest for a minute. Serve immediately with fresh lemon wedges on the side.
